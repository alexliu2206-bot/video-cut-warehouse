## 完整译文

波塔瓦托米语，罗宾从植物学家的角度来讲述，她也是波塔瓦托米族的一部分。她在章节开头谈到科学语言的不足，因为科学语言大多基于我们能看见的事物的标签。最初让她对学习波塔瓦托米语感兴趣的是一个词，那就是papawi，她这样写道。papawi，她解释说，意为使蘑菇一夜之间从地面冒出的力量。作为一名生物学家，我惊讶于这样的词存在。在西方科学所有的技术词汇中，没有这样的术语，没有词语来承载这种神秘。你可能会认为生物学家应该对生命有词汇。但在科学语言中，我们的术语用来定义我们知识的边界。我们无法把握的东西仍然没有名字。她去参加了这个会议，这是所有土著波塔瓦托米语者第一次在同一间屋子里，无论多久。在这本书写成的时候，只剩下九个土著语者。罗宾说，英语是一种以名词为基础的语言。对于一个如此迷恋事物的文化来说，这似乎很合适。只有30%的英语单词是动词。但在波塔瓦托米语中，这个比例是70%。 然后她继续讲述这个故事，关于她第一次听到用波塔瓦托米语谈论星期六时，实际上真的让她感到很烦。因为你不会说，今天是星期六。你会说，成为星期六。她觉得这没有意义。她想，你不能成为星期六，或者成为海湾。她想，你不能成为海湾。她觉得这在语法上很难理解。但她继续说，海湾只有在水是死的时才是名词。但动词Wikwagama，成为海湾，释放了水的束缚，让它活起来。成为山丘，成为沙滩，成为星期六，在一切都有生命的世界中，都是可能的动词，水、土地，甚至是一天。这种语言，是一面镜子，让我们看到世界的活力，贯穿一切事物的生命，通过松树、坚果孵化器和蘑菇。这是我在树林里听到的语言。这是让我们能够谈论我们周围涌现的一切的语言。在波塔瓦托米语和大多数其他土著语言中，我们用同样的词来称呼生活的世界，就像我们称呼家人一样。因为他们是我们的家人。我想回到罗宾说的关于英语主要是名词，以及这如何适用于一个如此迷恋事物的文化。罗宾的很多工作都是关于重新连接我们对周围世界的理解，这样我们就能看到我们触摸的一切的责任。 我们已经讨论过语言如何使我们能够将他人非人化，这也延伸到了我们周围的所谓事物。语言同样能够使我们贬低和贬低我们脚下的土地。我不想过于说教过度消费的问题，但我们花钱的方式可能意味着生命与生命之间的差异。
