## 完整译文

所有时间里，我都和其他创作者们待在一个房间里，他们和我一样有着相似的热情或兴趣。我几乎从未独自一人，所以在我待在安纳海姆的整个星期里，我的能量条都保持在绿色。在最后一天，当我最终回家并且独自一人时，感觉就像一整周的疲劳突然袭来，我昏睡了大约14个小时。我在VidCon之后基本上免费体验了一次死亡。这感觉很好。不管怎样，我真不知道这个视频的重点是什么。我已经看到很多关于内向者问题的帖子和视频，我总是觉得，嗯，无法感同身受。什么算是外向者的问题呢？所以我把它们画出来了。当然，这些只是我个人的经历。不是每个外向者都一样，也不是每个内向者都一样。所以也许你是一个外向者，但你并没有和我一样的问题。告诉我你的能量来源是什么。如果你也是一个从他人那里获得能量的艺术家，当你需要画一整天时，你如何保持生产力？我通常只是喝很多咖啡。你知道当我独自一人时我喜欢做什么吗？
