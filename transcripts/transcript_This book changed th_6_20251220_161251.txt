## 完整译文

它们往往因为三件事而容易被遗忘。第一，它们听起来很奇怪。就像我们的大脑倾向于以母语为导向，我们能识别语言中的所有声音并且能轻松区分它们。但如果是外语，一个我们从未听过的声音，我们的大脑就很难理解它们。所以我们很难记住它们。第二，他说外语单词没有特别的意义。所以如果你看到一个外语单词和一本教科书，你根本无法读懂它。你不知道它听起来像什么。它说，好的，这表示草稿，但你的大脑并没有将它与意义联系起来。最后一点是，你与它没有任何个人联系。他谈到，比如我说“巧克力碎片饼干”这个词，大多数在北美长大的人都会有一些惊人的个人记忆与之相关。你知道，你和妈妈或朋友一起烤饼干，把饼干从烤箱里拿出来，你知道，那种味道。
