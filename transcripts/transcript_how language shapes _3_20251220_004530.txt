## 完整译文

或者焦虑。我们身上有悲伤或焦虑。要说我很难过，我们说，请原谅我，我确信我会糟蹋这个。Tabran orm，我身上有悲伤。我很焦虑，to immy orm。我身上有焦虑。这种语言将这些视为短暂的状态，而不是我们身份的永久特征。现在暂且记住，爱尔兰语几乎灭绝，这不是巧合。这是所谓的语言灭绝，也就是语言杀戮的产物。我认为，当我们开始看到这些被系统性消灭的语言，作为通往不同世界观的大门，而不仅仅是一组词汇时，我就能开始理解为什么那些想要我认为我的时间是可以用来出售的殖民势力，也会发现沉默提供不同视角的语言非常重要。TikTok上有一个创作者叫做“工作中的单词”，他谈论了很多关于语言学的内容，强烈推荐关注他。他做了一个TikTok视频，讲述了使用“非法”和“不良分子”这样的词汇是多么正常。他说，你有没有听过一个非常糟糕的决定被描述为犯罪，或者一个真正的讨厌鬼被描述为不良分子？更直白地说，你有没有听过有人被描述为非法和非法？再想想这个。一个不仅仅是罪犯，而且他们的存在本身就是犯罪行为的人，因为他们敢在错误的时间出现在错误的地方。 他说所有这些例子都依赖于一个理解，即合法性和道德性是相同的。然后这要回到2024年。他在加利福尼亚提出了一个提议，禁止在该州以任何形式实行奴隶制。而六百五十万人投了反对票。所以他们投票决定保留奴隶制。这些人之所以投反对票，是因为奴隶制被描绘成对犯罪的惩罚。他继续说，我认为这必须是这一集的主题，但他说国家拥有暴力的权力，而语言拥有使其正常化的权力。我们需要非常意识到这种权力。嗨，第二天录音。我饿了也累了，但现在我们回来了。无论如何，我认为使用语言时需要的这种意识，不会变得暴力，这让我想到了“文化”这个词的词源，因为“文化”这个词实际上是一个农业隐喻。爱德华·S·凯西写道，这个词“文化”在中古英语中意味着铺设瓷砖的地方。同一个词可以追溯到拉丁语，collaire，居住、照顾、耕作、崇拜，成为文化的，拥有文化就是高效、密集地居住在一个地方，耕作它，对它负责，回应它，关心地关注它。我不知道为什么，当我第一次听到这个时，它真的打动了我，因为有趣的是隐喻是如何嵌入到单词本身的。 而在之前，我从未想过“文化”这个词的真正含义是什么，但它基本上意味着关心自己和他人，这很有道理。
