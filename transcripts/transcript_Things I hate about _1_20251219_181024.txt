那个班。然后坐在我旁边的家伙说，嘿，伙计，他以前也对我做过这种事，他从没给我记过考勤。我就给你留个印象吧。于是我就这么做了。我就直接在讲座中间走了出去，砰地一声关上门。然后我走到大学草坪上，扔下背包，躺在草地上，仰望着云彩。我喜欢想象那个教授在镜子前焦虑不安，哭泣的样子，但我永远不会知道。我再也没有回到那个班级。然后是班级本身的根本问题。报名参加大学课程就像是进入了一个平行现实的隧道，在那里你会受到一个全能的上帝的摆布，他控制着你近期未来的质量。我学了一年的日语，这是一门很难的科目，好吗？我勉强通过。我有座位，我为此感到骄傲。老师是一位上了年纪的女士，她规定如果你缺了三节课，你的成绩就会下降一个等级。这很公平，对吧？我缺了两节课。两节。然后，在最后一天上课时，她走到我跟前说，对不起，年轻人，你迟到了五次，五次迟到算作一节缺课。
