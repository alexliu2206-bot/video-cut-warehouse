对一个不公平的世界感到愤怒。我们大多数人都想成为她，或者和她在一起。这就像雷吉娜或米兰达，那种渴望拥有的气场。但Villanelle是一个被忽视欣赏她威严存在的女孩对世界进行报复时发生的事情。在小说中，强大的女性往往要么是愤怒的，要么是那种不在乎任何事情的酷女孩。看到一个既专横又迷人，情感丰富的表现是很好的。对于那些渴望更开放和性身份的人来说，Villanelle代表了纯粹的抑制。她喜欢漂亮的男孩，米尔斯，三个拇指，她会戴上胡须，跳舞，这些都不会以任何方式让她感到压力。她在性别表达和性取向上是自信的，这是很多人无法做到的，看到这一点让人感到满足，尤其是当她经常扮演追求者的角色时，这在女性中是众所周知的不常见的。被一个你相互迷恋的自信女性追逐的想法有点不同。在头发上-
