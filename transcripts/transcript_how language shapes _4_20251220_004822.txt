## 完整译文

在你身边，但我认为这个隐喻的自然方面使其不仅仅局限于你周围的人，还包括你周围的环境，这让我们更接近我们接下来要讨论的内容，即罗宾·威尔德基默关于活性语法的理念。但在我们深入这个话题之前，我想谈谈这篇名为《互联网的巴尔干化和巴别塔化》的文章，作者是如一和红宝石·正义。他们说，我们创造新词汇的速度，然后将它们重新置于夸张的梗图和笑话格式中，比以往任何时候都要快，这是在我们这个无情的在线讨论时代。随着我们被喂食更多的内容，我们被推得更深进入算法化的小众领域。作为回报，我们被鼓励与更极端和两极化的标识符互动，因为它更容易被机器标记和索引，创造了所谓的“孤岛”。巴别塔化是这样一个过程：在分裂之后，孤立的数字群体发展出独特的语言，这使得重新整合和共享数字空间变得困难，甚至不可能。当某人认为他们的孤立语言和在线回音室是普遍的现实时，当同一个个体被置于其他人不了解他们的语言的情境中时，冲突就会发生，因为他们根本误解了彼此。这真的很有趣，因为我觉得有时这甚至发生在我自己的评论区。 有时候人们说些什么，我就会想，是的，这从技术上讲是英语，但你刚才说的话对我来说太脱离上下文了，我完全不知道你在说什么。我认为我们刚刚通过查理·柯克的案例非常清楚地看到了这一点，子弹壳上写的东西就是如此。然后互联网上的每个人都在涌入这个空间，说，我认为这就是它的意思。我认为这就是它的意思。这就是人们在discord服务器上说的，试图追溯这些像模因化的说法，寻找某种意义上的相似之处。所以你有那些认为他们在说一些有意义的话的人，但实际上他们就像是在云端之上，地面上的人根本不知道他们在说什么。这正是另类右翼管道变得棘手的地方，因为你有这些狗哨，它们被嵌入到这些模因中，只有群体中的一些人能认出来。狗哨的定义是使用编码或暗示性的语言和政治信息，以获得特定群体的支持。有趣的是，这种策略的标题本身就是一个本质上的非人化隐喻。这是为了孤立。所以我认为答案不是像打败他们一样，制造我们自己的排他性语言。 相反，我认为对狗哨的反应应该是朝相反方向跑，那就是找到某种团结因素，可以使英语回归到有助于人性化人们及其所居住的土地以及他们共同生活的生物，而不是加倍使用狗哨。这让我想到了育种套草地。这是我整个对话中最喜欢的部分。我谈论育种套草地的次数太多了，我几年前读到它，我仍然回去读它，就像它是我的圣经一样。当我为这一集做研究时，我想起了育种套草地中的一章，罗宾·威尔德基默在其中谈到了她尝试的经历。
