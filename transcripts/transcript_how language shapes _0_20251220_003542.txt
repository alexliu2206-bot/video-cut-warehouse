嗨，亲爱的朋友们。欢迎回到《野鹅》。我是你们的主持人，安娜。今天我们要讨论的是，我们语言的局限性就是我们世界的局限性。我得说，这个话题对我来说有点难，因为很多内容都涉及到语言学。我对语言学一无所知。我在大学时从未上过语言学课程。但是有几个小的好奇心让我对语言如何可能改变我们的世界观产生了兴趣。所以，我连续和朋友们进行了几次对话，我们讨论了英语语言常常感觉像是试图将我们划分为这些静态的身份，我们谈论的方式，甚至是我们的情感。我们说，我很难过，而不是说，我正在经历悲伤。或者像我们思考依恋理论时，我们说，我是回避型的。我是焦虑的，而不是说我表现出焦虑行为。我表现出回避行为。我想意识到一个事实，那就是很多听《野鹅》的人并不以英语作为第一语言。所以我真的很想听听你们对这一切的看法。但由于我只流利地说英语，我认为这极大地限制了我的世界观。我最近一直在努力学习西班牙语。本着学习新事物的精神，感谢今天的赞助商，Crafsy。Crafsy 是你的在线资源，提供所有创意事物。 你可以体验到用双手创造独一无二的东西所带来的满足感。我亲自参加过像Kawaii Ami Karumi Kroche这样的课程，由Stacy Troc教授，或者Ethan Colitan教授的如何画树。最近我参加了Judith Castle Mammoth的课程，学习如何用表达性页面记录日常生活，因为我对模拟档案和将事物从互联网上移除越来越感兴趣。但我过去制作的垃圾日志页面从未让我完全满意，但Judith提供了一些处理混合媒体的非常棒的技巧。她甚至有一个部分讲解如何制作更多互动元素，比如弹出页面，这真的很酷。我知道，这将使回顾旧时记忆变得更加特别。Craftsy课程包括分步骤指导和有用的可下载资源，使学习变得容易。所以无论你是想绘画、烘焙还是写作，Craftsy都能满足你的需求，他们总是在创造新课程，让你不断回来学习更多，并帮助你保持灵感。前1000名点击节目描述中链接的人将只需1美元和49美分就能获得Craftsy一年的高级会员资格，仅限新会员。但无论如何，我多年来一直在尝试学习西班牙语。我希望有一天我能真正深入地沉浸在这门语言中，这是我至今还未能实现的。 但让我对这一切产生好奇的另一件事是，我开始使用应用语言转移功能，我在前几天发布的视频博客中稍微提到了这一点。语言转移非常酷，因为它利用你已经从你的语言中知道的东西，将其转移到你正在尝试学习的语言中，而不是仅仅教你一大堆词汇。它还为你提供了很多语言背景，这是像Duolingo这样的应用从未做到的。我会快速说完这一点，因为它有点旁枝末节，但对我来说非常吸引人。有一个规则适用于英语中的许多、许多单词。
