## 完整译文

又缺了一次课，所以你现在确实，你这个愚蠢的家伙！我花了整整10分钟才理解她告诉我的话，那就是这位女士在没有任何警告的情况下，最后一天基本上让我在她的课上不及格。我发誓，在我的一生中，我几乎从不迟到，即使迟到也从不超过5分钟。你可能会认为她会在课堂上提一下这个特别具体的评分机制，但没有，所以这真是太棒了！最糟糕的是同一门课在不同教授之间可以有多么不同。我记得那个学期，我和我的朋友们，包括两个工程专业和一个建筑专业的学生，都被要求参加音乐欣赏课，首先，这到底是什么鬼！但其次，我们不知怎么的被分配给了不同的教授，他们教授的是同一门课程。现在我朋友们的教授根本不关心这个课，它完全是在线开卷的，所以他们只是在网上搜索每个作业。另一方面，我的教授却是一个病态、扭曲的混蛋，他的课完全是面对面的，每隔几周我们就要回答50个问题...
