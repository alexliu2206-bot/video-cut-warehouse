## 完整译文

以T-I-O-N结尾的语言，你可以直接将其转换为西班牙语，只需将其改为C-I-O-N。例如，imagination（想象力）就会变成Imajinaseon，请原谅我的发音。然后，你可以通过简单地将结尾从C-I-O-N改为A-R来找到成千上万的西班牙语动词，这样的改变会将imagination变成imagine（想象）。所以，它就变成了Imajinar。你可以用这种方法转换很多单词。你可以将conversation（对话）变成conversación，然后变成conversaar，如此这般，无穷无尽。当我在听我的语言转换课程时，让我印象深刻的是，如果你将单词experimentation（实验）转换为西班牙语expedimentaseón，然后将其变为动词expedimentar，那么它意味着实验，同时也意味着体验。所以，在西班牙语中，两个词“体验”和“实验”是相同的，老师只是谈论了这本身可能是一个小小的生活教训，就像那些简单的单词是体验周围世界的一种特殊方式。这些就是这集节目诞生的好奇心的种子。而就在我对这个问题产生好奇心的同时，我的男朋友也在以一种非常不同的方式对它产生好奇。我只是觉得有趣的是，当我开始研究时，我的好奇心和他的好奇心走向了不同的方向。 几周前，他开始深入研究原始印欧语，如果你没听说过原始印欧语，我建议你自己去查一下，因为我不想在这里跑题。但基本上，他开始对一个叫做比较历史语言学的语言学分支产生了兴趣。我对他大脑的运作方式印象深刻，因为他就这样陷入了这个兔子洞。然后第二天他就能拿出一张地图，向我展示这些语言是如何在历史上被追踪的。这对我来说简直难以置信，但我的大脑并不像他的那样对这些内容产生共鸣。最终让我对语言学产生兴趣的是所谓的语言相对性。我想当我最初坐下来为这一集做研究时，我试图强迫我的好奇心朝他的方向走。但我们的大脑只是指向了不同的探究线索，你懂的。所以我不得不暂时放弃那个。实际上，我有一个听众建议我链接到一个播客，特别是关于优越码头的那一集。 根据字典，萨丕尔-沃尔夫假说是由爱德华·萨丕尔在1929年首次提出，并由本杰明·沃尔夫进一步发展的一种假设，即一种语言的结构决定了母语使用者对经验的感知和分类。这可以说是语言学中语言相对论分支的开端。但需要更正的是，萨丕尔-沃尔夫假说并非语言学中语言相对论分支的起点。它是19世纪更多发生的对话的延续。
