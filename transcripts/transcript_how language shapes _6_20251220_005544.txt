## 完整译文

我们与地球上共享生命的生物的死亡。这是我们肩负的重大责任。我指的不仅仅是环境。如果你一直在关注，你就会看到吉米·基梅尔和迪士尼之间发生了什么，以及对迪士尼的所有抵制，以及吉米·基梅尔是如何因为大规模抵制而回归的，就像迪士尼损失了数十亿美元一样。我认为，对于真正想要实现真正变革的人来说，我们确实需要改变我们的思维过程，停止将我们周围的所谓事物仅仅视为事物。罗宾谈到，在波塔瓦托米语中，例如，如果你看到一株植物，你不会问，这是什么？你会说，那是谁？我最近读了罗宾写的另一本书，叫做《服务浆果》。她说，我们的思维方式如何影响我们的行为。如果我们将这些浆果或那个春天视为一个物体，视为财产，它可以在市场经济中被剥削为商品。当某物从礼物的地位转变为商品的地位时，我们可能会变得与相互责任脱节。这有点涉及到她在《服务浆果》中阐述的更广泛的礼物经济理念，强烈推荐大家去看看。但我想深入探讨这个想法，即我们的思维方式如何影响我们的行为，并回到我之前谈到的优越码头假说。优越码头假说不仅仅表明我们说话的方式改变了我们的思维方式。 它甚至说我们说话的方式改变了我们实际感知现实的方式。我承认，围绕这个假设有一些争议，我并不完全确定我完全理解。所以语言学家们，请在我不可避免地说错话时在评论中发表意见。但是有一篇关于Ion的文章叫做《我们的语言我们的世界》，它触及了语言学界对这一观点的分歧。它说在不同语言之间切换时，我们可能会感觉像是从一个世界步入另一个世界。但这只是一种幻觉吗？每种语言真的体现了不同的世界观，甚至为其说话者规定了特定的思维模式吗？围绕语言相对性的反复怀疑不仅因为难以确定它，而且因为对相对主义教条的假设和含义的根深蒂固的矛盾情绪。当我读到这一点时，我就像，这完全有道理，我最好奇的事情就是最难用绝对性来确定的事情。但当然，关于人们如何感知世界的问题将非常难以量化。所以在20世纪40年代，本杰明·李·沃尔夫实际上对霍皮人进行了这项研究，他得出结论说霍皮人没有时间概念，因为他们没有引用我们所说的时间的直接词汇、语法形式、构造或表达。 基本上，这项研究存在很多缺陷，我不太明白，因为我不是科学家。据我了解，这很快就被推翻了。我想，对那项研究的不当处理确实助长了对语言相对性的怀疑。但在SAR语言中，我们的世界，萨姆·德雷瑟说，无法忽视这些问题的语言学家和心理学家已经将相对性重新带入学术主流。
