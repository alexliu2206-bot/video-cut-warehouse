## 完整译文

体验地球对你的身体产生的引力，或者感受作为一个跨性别者不仅被所使用的语言接受，而且被置于其中心。回到关于巴比伦人的文章，他们说巴比伦人携带的身份，不仅仅在言语中，还在手势、歌曲和仪式中。这些是具体化的真理，不是教科书。原住民的记忆过去是，现在仍然是一个全身实践。这让我想起了文章最后提到的，我们的互联网小众亚文化正在分裂英语。那篇文章提出的解决这个问题的方法基本上是，我们需要重新与人类的接触连接起来，以弥补由所有这些互联网小众亚文化不和谐语言创造的差距，这些语言最终使我们与我们面前的社区隔离。当我最初读到这个结论时，我就像，嗯，我不知道这对我有多有说服力。就像，我不知道出于某种原因，我就是觉得，好吧，所以更多地不理解彼此使用英语的方式。所以我们应该更多地相互接触，就像它对我来说并没有真正点击。我仍然不太确定那个问题的答案是什么。但我想我希望能够更多地倾听原住民的智慧，这样我就可以，我不知道，体现一个超越英语自动给我的世界观。 我只是想回到布雷迪·甜草那里，再读一遍关于生命语法章节的结尾。她说，我并不是主张我们都应该学习波塔瓦托米语、霍皮语或塞米诺尔语，即使我们能够做到。移民们带着各种语言的遗产来到这些海岸，所有这些语言都值得珍惜。但是，要成为这个地方的土著，如果我们想在这里生存，我们的邻居也想生存，我们的工作就是学会说生命语法。这样我们才能真正感到宾至如归。我记得比尔·塔尔布尔的话，他是一个害羞的长者。年轻时，我怀着沉重的心情与他交谈，哀叹我没有母语来与我所爱的植物和地方对话。他们喜欢听古老的语言。他说，这是真的。但他用手指放在嘴唇上说，如果你在这里说，就不必在这里说。他说，拍着他的胸膛。他们会听到你的。我认为这是一个很好的结束语，因为我认为我的观点并不是说，你知道，我们所有人都需要去学习一大堆语言。我的意思是，如果你现在有能力和时间去做这件事，那太棒了。但我知道很多人正处于生存模式，也许你脑海中最后一件事就是去学习语言。但如果对你来说情况确实如此，我仍然认为即使你不懂另一种语言，或者你没有时间去学习，通过倾听和关注原住民智慧，你仍然可以获得很多。 不要回到将时间比作金钱的比喻，但如果你觉得自己时间太紧张，无法投入到学习新语言中，也许你可以开始倾听你可以如何使用你已经会说的语言，以及那些让你回归自身、与周围环境重新建立联系的方式。我们不必都生活在云端，忘记如何交谈。
