## 完整译文

从你的语言开始，即使在一周内有不同的想法，我想知道我是否能够学习瑞典语、越南语和德语。你知道，开始学习所有这些语言，开始涉猎它们。总的来说，就是有一种愿望，希望能够用你的语言学习做到这一切。这并不一定是坏事。然而，当你重新评估你是什么样的语言学习者时，这是值得思考的事情。如果你正在考虑的事情妨碍了你目前的目标。最后，D代表延迟。你计划为自己设定多长的期限来实现那个目标？这个方程实际上认为，如果你不断地被你的想法、你的冲动分散注意力，那么你将很难在语言学习中采取有意义的长期项目的行动。很容易分心。通常这个方程发现的是，你越是屈服于冲动，随着时间的推移，你会感到越来越没有动力。如果你有一个具体的目标，而那个目标的期限更远，你会感到完成它的动力越小。
