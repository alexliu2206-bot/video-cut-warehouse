book, Fluent Forever by Gabriel Weiner. And so I was actually just walking in the bookstore the other day and I was walking in the linguistic section and I saw this book. And the title Fluent Forever, how to learn any language fast and never forget it. I have to say I looked at that and I scoffed. So those of you who are familiar with me, I have spent the last 13 or so years obsessively learning Korean and I would say it took me at least a few years before I would say I was fluent in Korean. And so seeing something like this, like learn any language fast, it just makes me feel like it's either a scam or it's so great that I'm feeling a little embarrassed that I took so long to get fluent in Korean. I decided to look online and find some reviews and can you believe it? This is one of the best selling.

## 完整译文

书籍，《永远流利》由加布里埃尔·魏纳所著。前几天我正好在书店里走着，我走到了语言学区域，然后看到了这本书。书名是《永远流利》，如何快速学习任何语言并且永远不会忘记。我得说，我看了那个标题后嗤之以鼻。所以，那些熟悉我的人知道，我在过去大约13年里一直在痴迷地学习韩语，我会说我至少花了几年时间才敢说我韩语流利。所以看到这样的书，比如快速学习任何语言，让我觉得它要么是个骗局，要么它太棒了，让我有点尴尬，因为我花了这么长时间才流利掌握韩语。我决定上网查找一些评论，你能相信吗？这是最畅销的书之一。
