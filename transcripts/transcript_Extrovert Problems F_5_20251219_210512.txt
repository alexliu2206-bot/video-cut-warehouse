这并不一定意味着你散发出自信？好吧，在VidCon前一周，我既兴奋又紧张得要命。因为紧张，我睡不好也吃不下。好吧，我将和一群动画师待上整整一周。一群我从未见过……也从未真正交流过的动画师。如果他们不喜欢我怎么办？不，不，我会出去表现得超级友好。一切都会好的。但如果我给人留下不好的第一印象怎么办？我在社区里不认识任何人，所以如果我在VidCon上搞砸了，或者一辈子都搞砸了，他们就再也不会想和我说话了，还有那些性格不合的人！你知道，如果情况真的那么糟糕，你总是可以坐火车回家。我只是希望事情不要发展到那一步。而事实上，并没有。实际上，我和每个人都很快就相处得很好，尽管我可能在第一天有些尴尬，但每个人都非常热情，这让社交变得容易多了，我也可以更自在地做自己。顺便说一下，VidCon简直就是社交天堂。想想看……
