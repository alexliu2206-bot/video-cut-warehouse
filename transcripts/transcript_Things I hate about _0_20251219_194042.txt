## 完整译文

大学真是个复杂的地方。感觉每有一个在那里真正找到自我的人，就有三个人迷失自我，然后还有大约20个人在一两年后就辍学，损失了数千美元。长大后，我记得人们告诉我大学出勤并不重要，你甚至可以想逃课就逃课，然后我来到这里，几乎每堂课都有某种出勤积分，如果你不去，就会完全被坑。我记得大一有一次，我上了一堂完全没用的工程迎新课，一些杂七杂八的教授进来做演讲，讲如何建造一个乐高机器人手臂，帮你挖鼻子和擦屁股，我去的唯一原因是它占了我成绩的20%，他们让你用这些小点击器设备签到，但我那天忘了带，所以我不得不用手机应用签到，这让你登录大学账户三次才能使用，我一直输错密码，老师关闭了签到，我问他我能不能得到出勤分，他只是开了个模糊的玩笑，让我在大家面前像个白痴一样。
