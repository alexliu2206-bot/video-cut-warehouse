## 完整译文

你为自己的语言付出了很多，但并没有看到太多进展。你可能会觉得自己正处于中级阶段的停滞期。然而，你仍在以学习的节奏进步。这个阶段的优点是它更可持续。第三种季节被称为恢复性休息，你从你的语言学习中彻底休息，或者如果你学习多种语言，就从其中一种语言中彻底休息。这有助于大脑整合信息，这样你就可以在完成恢复性休息阶段后，回到快速进步阶段或逐渐成长阶段。所以，帮助自己重新评估，我现在处于哪个阶段？实际上，你增加语言学习动力的能力受到你目前所处的语言学习季节的影响。现在，在评估了你的语言学习季节之后，让我们看看你可以问自己的问题，以增加我们四个角色的价值，对于那些自我评分很低的人来说。向克莱尔提出这些问题。
