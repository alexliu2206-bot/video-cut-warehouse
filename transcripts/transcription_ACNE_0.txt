**[00:00]** Acne was invented by Satan's grandma in the deepest pits of hell, and I have had the blessing of suffering from it for all of my teenage and early adult life.

**[00:10]** Like there's pimples and then there's acne. One is a temporary annoyance and the other is a eldritch curse. It just refuses to go away despite you trying all these increasingly bizarre solutions.

**[00:21]** For me it started getting really bad around my sophomore year of college. My mom was asking me for a selfie because she missed her handsome boy, and I sent one and she's like, we're taking you to a dermatologist.

**[00:31]** Like damn! So that summer I went to the dermat and I was assigned the scary man with a thick Eastern European accent that looked like he had survived both World Wars as a high ranking officer.

**[00:41]** And the first thing he did was he saw a mole on my arm and he was like, oh, this is cancer. What? Oh my god, are you serious? No, but he could become cancer. No, don't move. What are you gonna do?

**[00:53]** And he took off a piece of my skin and I still have a scar from it, but at least I didn't get cancer.

Acne was invented by Satan's grandma in the deepest pits of hell, and I have had the blessing of suffering from it for all of my teenage and early adult life. Like there's pimples and then there's acne. One is a temporary annoyance and the other is a eldritch curse. It just refuses to go away despite you trying all these increasingly bizarre solutions. For me it started getting really bad around my sophomore year of college. My mom was asking me for a selfie because she missed her handsome boy, and I sent one and she's like, we're taking you to a dermatologist. Like damn! So that summer I went to the dermat and I was assigned the scary man with a thick Eastern European accent that looked like he had survived both World Wars as a high ranking officer. And the first thing he did was he saw a mole on my arm and he was like, oh, this is cancer. What? Oh my god, are you serious? No, but he could become cancer. No, don't move. What are you gonna do? And he took off a piece of my skin and I still have a scar from it, but at least I didn't get cancer.
