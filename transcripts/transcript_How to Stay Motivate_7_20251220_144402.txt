Using this particular language learning method that is currently involved in my language learning studies, that's value. And how likely do you feel you will receive the payoff of getting to your language goals via the current resources that you're using? That's expectancy. How far away is your deadline? With accomplishing this language learning goal, delay, and how are you as you take action? That is impulsivity. So give a score of 1 to 10 for each of these questions. For rating value, 1 is you don't care at all. 10 is this is extremely valuable for you. Expectancy 1 means it is highly unlikely that you'll receive a payoff. 10 is you are as certain as can be that you will receive payoff. Delay. Put 1 if there is no delay. The deadline is the closest that it could be. Put 10 if the deadline is far off or you don't even have a deadline at all. Impulsivity. Put 1 if you are hyper focused. And put a 10 if you feel you are immensely distractible. And again, feel free to put a number in between 1 and 10.

## 完整译文

使用这种目前参与我的语言学研究的特殊语言学习方法，这就是价值。你觉得通过你目前使用的资源实现语言目标的可能性有多大？这就是期望值。你的截止日期有多远？在实现这个语言学习目标的过程中，延迟了多少，你采取行动时的状态如何？这就是冲动性。所以请为这些问题分别打1到10分。对于价值评分，1表示你完全不在乎，10表示这对你来说极其有价值。期望值1意味着你收到回报的可能性非常低，10表示你非常确定你会收到回报。延迟。如果没有延迟，截止日期尽可能接近，就打1分。如果截止日期很远或者你根本没有截止日期，就打10分。冲动性。如果你非常专注，就打1分。如果你觉得自己非常容易分心，就打10分。同样，你可以在1到10之间随意打分。
