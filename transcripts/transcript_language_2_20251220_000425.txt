那种语言。所以我在阅读这本书时会考虑这三件事。让我们来谈谈概览。加布里埃尔·魏纳，他在第一章基本上以三个关键的语言学习原则开始这本书。它们是什么？首先，他认为你应该先学习发音。作者加布里埃尔·魏纳实际上有作为一名前歌剧歌手的训练。所以他在甚至学习那些语言之前就学会了不同语言中许多单词的正确发音。他觉得这在他的语言学习中给了他很大的提升。我认为这是一个不错的主意。所以我们想更多地了解这一点。第二，不要翻译。这也与他的经验有关。所以他参加了很多沉浸式项目。他说他开始了一个法语沉浸式项目，当时他一点法语都不懂。然后他以一个高级法语使用者的身份从项目中毕业。所以沉浸式项目基本上是你花几周或者可能几个月的时间。
