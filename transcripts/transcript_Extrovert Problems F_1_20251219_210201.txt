当他们独自一人时，电量很低，但通过与他人社交能够重新充电。与普遍看法相反，内向并不意味着你自动就有焦虑和讨厌其他人，外向也不意味着你天生就有良好的公共演讲技巧。我就是这个事实的典型例子。实际上，我在进行演讲和对一群人讲话时非常糟糕。也许我只是缺乏那种魅力。我认为我的室友和我有非常相似的性格，但在漫长的工作日结束后，她会说，我真的筋疲力尽，没有精力和任何人说话，所以我要去坐着弯着腰看厨房噩梦。与此同时，在漫长的工作日结束后，我通常就像，嘿，你有空吗？我度过了漫长的一天，我想犒劳自己去吃寿司，但我没有人一起去。猜猜谁是内向者，谁是外向者？我认为回顾一些外向者的问题会很有趣，或者至少是我看待它们的方式。首先，当我独自一人时，我什么也做不了。你可能会认为，独自一人时有所有的空闲时间——
