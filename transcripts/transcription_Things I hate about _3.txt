**[00:00]** No notes allowed exam in which we had to memorize like 15 different classical music pieces

**[00:04]** and answer questions like how many moles were on Beethoven's left testicle.

**[00:08]** I literally almost failed that class, it obliterated my GPA along with Japanese,

**[00:13]** and yet my friends passed without studying or attending class once.

**[00:16]** And according to the school, these are the exact same class!

**[00:20]** Are you seeing the problem here?

**[00:22]** And then you realize that all this bullshit is just a relic of the pre-internet world.

**[00:26]** School has gone from being a necessary archive of critical information to an arbitrary list of

**[00:30]** subjects whose victims are forced to attend and are punished when they don't learn the right things

**[00:34]** in the right way at the right time. Here's some random information on a topic you don't give

**[00:38]** a rat's ass about! Learn it by next week or you're objectively a bad person according to

**[00:43]** our grading system that condenses a person's collective knowledge into a single number!

**[00:47]** This is quite possibly the most effective way to make someone hate learning possible!

**[00:53]** I do realize I'm ranting a lot here and I want to end this video off on a positive note.

No notes allowed exam in which we had to memorize like 15 different classical music pieces and answer questions like how many moles were on Beethoven's left testicle. I literally almost failed that class, it obliterated my GPA along with Japanese, and yet my friends passed without studying or attending class once. And according to the school, these are the exact same class! Are you seeing the problem here? And then you realize that all this bullshit is just a relic of the pre-internet world. School has gone from being a necessary archive of critical information to an arbitrary list of subjects whose victims are forced to attend and are punished when they don't learn the right things in the right way at the right time. Here's some random information on a topic you don't give a rat's ass about! Learn it by next week or you're objectively a bad person according to our grading system that condenses a person's collective knowledge into a single number! This is quite possibly the most effective way to make someone hate learning possible! I do realize I'm ranting a lot here and I want to end this video off on a positive note. So I'll say this!
